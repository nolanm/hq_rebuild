==========

The beginning stages of rebuilding hq.mcstate.com. The backend headquarters for mcstate.com

McState.com allows McDonald's to customize the local customer experience for each of there 14,000+ U.S. 
franchise locations.

The daunting task of providing local relevant digital content combined with overall brand messaging for 14,000+ 
locations is where the HQ comes in to play.

The HQ provides the insight for development, evolution, training and support needed to manage and expand a 
powerful CMS system.

It allows franchise owners, Coop administrators, Regional administrators, Divistional Administrators,
Coop & Regional Agency Employees, and National Administrators to provide the location infromation,
digital marketing, and hiring needs right to the consumer.

The rebuild will dramatically change the structure of the HQ. There will be a brand new permissions system 
that will allow franchise operators to create new administrators at the restaurant level and
grant them individual permissions based on restaurant and functionality. 

The rebuild was neccessary when making this significant of a change to the underlying architecture of the site,
since every acpect of the site will now be based on what permissions the user has.


This website is built on thd CodeIgniter framework, and is using the Bootstrap front-end framework.

With the CodeIgniter framework, the HQ will now be in an MVC style format and hence much easier to develope and maintain.

The Bootstrap front-end framework will allow for faster rebuild, and best of all, a sleek and responsive design.
